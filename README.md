## Setting Up Your Environment and Executing
- In order to execute our working code, all you need to do is navigate into the `testMain` directory.
- Once you've done that, execute the code using `python main.py`
## Dependencies
- The dependencies we've used in our Python program consist of the following: `json, networkx, numpy, random`
- All of our dependencies should work by default (without any external download source) except for `networkx`
## Progress
- We are currently using a test data file with a limited number of movies but the recommendation accuracy should be consistent
### Notice
- We had to make up our data because our original data that we retrieved from the test file has an inefficient structure to it and we were having issues on how to properly feed it to the main recommendation function, but besides that, our main recommendation algorithm is working.
